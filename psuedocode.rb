# PSEUDO-CODE
=begin
LOOP until a number has not been added on a full pass of the board or solved
  - Go through every blank single cell on the board
  - Generate a list of possible numbers
    - Possible numbers can be eliminated based on row, col, grid and ???
=end
=begin
Other ideas to solve advanced problems:
Make a guess and loop through board and check if a number can be added.  Keep making guesses using recursion.
